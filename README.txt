My Feedback:
============
I find the code to be more than satisfactory, given the task's requirements and expectations. It demonstrates good readability, 
maintainability, and flexibility.

The code structure, including its layers, is well organized and contributes to easy management and future feature implementation.

Reasons for Not Labeling the Code as "Awesome":
==============================================
While the code certainly showcases positive aspects, I believe there are some areas that could be further enhanced:

- Superfluous spaces and empty lines could be trimmed to improve code cleanliness.
- In certain sections, the absence of spaces makes the code appear slightly complex and harder to follow.
- Some variables were not being used, leading to unnecessary clutter.
- A few segments of the code seemed redundant and could be removed.
- Some function comments were either missing or incomplete, which could make understanding their purpose less intuitive.

My Contributions:
================
I took the liberty to refactor the code for improved clarity. Shorthand coding techniques were employed, and unnecessary spaces 
were removed to enhance the overall readability and aesthetics of the code. 
In addition, I added appropriate spaces to ensure a consistent and pleasing visual presentation. Function comments were either 
added or completed, aiming to provide comprehensive context to each function's role and functionality.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!
